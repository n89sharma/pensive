* Philosophy
Why can I not remember the books that I read?
I cannot remember the books that I read for the following reasons:
(1) My english skills are lacking, therefore I cannot understand the point the author is trying to convey.
(2) I do not read actively; I do not question what the author claims; a book turns into a lecture rather than a
    conversation. Without personal reflection any new information is left in short term memory.
(3) I do not think critically while I read. If the conclusions and reasoning of every author is taken at face value then
    as a reader you are likely to be convinced by multiple contradictory claims.
(4) The topic of the book does not interest me or I cannot relate to the topic.
(5)

There are two steps for better comprehension:
(1) Know exactly what the author is trying to convey.
(2) Have your own notes that:
    (a) Check the validity of the claims made by the author (Critical Thinking).
    (b) Apply a concept to beyond what is discussed in the book.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should paragraphs have a business key that the user can refer to it by? book, chapter, section, number, tags?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
book has a table of contents.
each paragraph has a link to a book through book address.
how do I get the relevant paragraphs on the screen? load all paragraphs from a chapter?
list of books -> user picks a book. book links to the table of contents
table of contents -> user picks a chapter
table of contents -> user picks a section

all the paragraphs under that section or chapter are returned in sequence.
when the user moves away or closes the window the paragraph id is sent back as reference.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
what can the user do to move away from a view?
- press a button to go to the next view
- select another chapter or section from the table of contents?
- search for a word in the entire book?
- search for a tag in the entire book?
- search for an image in the notes?
- search a view based on visual cues for the location of the content.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
How would the display change based on the paragraph length?
