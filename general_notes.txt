* Philosophy
Why can I not remember the books that I read?
I cannot remember the books that I read for the following reasons:
(1) My english skills are lacking, therefore I cannot understand the point the author is trying to convey.
(2) I do not read actively; I do not question what the author claims; a book turns into a lecture rather than a
    conversation. Without personal reflection any new information is left in short term memory.
(3) I do not think critically while I read. If the conclusions and reasoning of every author is taken at face value then
    as a reader you are likely to be convinced by multiple contradictory claims.
(4) The topic of the book does not interest me or I cannot relate to the topic.
(5)

There are two steps for better comprehension:
(1) Know exactly what the author is trying to convey.
(2) Have your own notes that:
    (a) Check the validity of the claims made by the author (Critical Thinking).
    (b) Apply a concept to beyond what is discussed in the book.
