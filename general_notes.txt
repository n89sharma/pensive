Should paragraphs have a business key that the user can refer to it by? book, chapter, section, number, tags?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
book has a table of contents.
each paragraph has a link to a book through book address.
how do I get the relevant paragraphs on the screen? load all paragraphs from a chapter?
list of books -> user picks a book. book links to the table of contents
table of contents -> user picks a chapter
table of contents -> user picks a section

all the paragraphs under that section or chapter are returned in sequence.
when the user moves away or closes the window the paragraph id is sent back as reference.
